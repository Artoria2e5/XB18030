Abstract: WTF-8 (Wobbly Transformation Format − 8-bit) is a super-set of <a>UTF-8</a> that allows unpaired <a>surrogate code points</a>. It is meant to represent in a way compatible with UTF-8 data from legacy systems such as JavaScript and Windows APIs that use <a>UTF-16</a> internally but don’t enforce the invariant that surrogates must be paired.

<h2 id=terminology>Terminology</h2>

  These definitions correspond to those of the
  <a href="http://www.unicode.org/glossary/">Glossary of Unicode Terms</a> [[!UNICODE]],
  except for <a>code unit</a> which is slightly different for the purpose of this specification.

  A Unicode <dfn>code point</dfn> is any value in the Unicode codespace;
  that is, the range of integers from 0 to 1114111.
  It is noted with a “U+” prefix and four to six hexadecimal digits:
  the first and last code points are U+0000 and U+10FFFF.

  The <dfn>Basic Multilingual Plane</dfn> is
  the range of <a>code points</a> from U+0000 to U+FFFF.

  A <dfn>BMP code point</dfn> is a <a>code point</a> in the <a>Basic Multilingual Plane</a>.

  A <dfn>supplementary code point</dfn>
  is a <a>code point</a> in the range from U+10000 to U+10FFFF.
  That is, a code point not in the Basic Multilingual Plane.

  A <dfn>surrogate code point</dfn>
  is a <a>code point</a> in the range from U+D800 to U+DFFF.

  A <dfn>Unicode scalar value</dfn>
  is a <a>code point</a> that is not a <a>surrogate code point</a>.
  That is, a code point in the range from U+0000 to U+D7FF, or U+E000 to U+10FFFF.

  <dfn>Unicode text</dfn> is a sequence of <a>Unicode scalar values</a>.

  <dfn>UTF-8</dfn> is an encoding of <a>Unicode text</a> using 8-bit bytes.
  Each <a>Unicode scalar value</a> is represented asq a sequence of one to four bytes.

  <dfn>UTF-16</dfn> is an encoding of <a>Unicode text</a> using 16-bit <a>code units</a>.
  <a>BMP code points</a> (other than <a title="surrogate code point">surrogates</a>)
  are represented as a single <a>code unit</a> with the same value.
  <a>Supplementary code points</a>
  are represented as a <a>surrogate pair</a> of <a>code units</a>.

  A <dfn>code unit</dfn>, for the purpose of this specification,
  is a 16-bit integer used in <a>UTF-16</a>.
  It is noted with a “0x” prefix and four hexadecimal digits:
  the first and last code units are 0x0000 and 0xFFFF.

  Note: The byte serialization of a <a>code unit</a> (little-endian or big-endian)
  is out of scope for this specification.

  Note: Unicode also uses this term for 8-bit and 32-bit code units
  in the UTF-8 and UTF-32 encodings.

  A <dfn>lead surrogate</dfn> or <dfn>high surrogate</dfn> code unit
  is a <a>code unit</a> in the range from 0xD800 to 0xDBFF.

  A <dfn>trail surrogate</dfn> or <dfn>low surrogate</dfn> code unit
  is a <a>code unit</a> in the range from 0xDC00 to 0xDFFF.

  A <dfn>surrogate pair</dfn> is a sequence of
  a <a>lead surrogate</a> followed by a <a>trail surrogate</a>.
  In <a>UTF-16</a>, it represents a <a>supplementary code point</a>.
