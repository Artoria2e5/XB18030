Abstract: WTF-8 (Wobbly Transformation Format − 8-bit) is a superset of <a>UTF-8</a> that encodes <a>surrogate code points</a> if they are not in a <a title="surrogate code point pair">pair</a>. It represents, in a way compatible with UTF-8, text from systems such as JavaScript and Windows that use <a>UTF-16</a> internally but don’t enforce the <a>well-formedness</a> invariant that surrogates must be paired.

<h2 id=motivation>
Background and motivation</h2>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  When <a href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode1.0.0/">Unicode 1.0</a>
  was published in 1991,
  it defined 65536 <a>code points</a> from U+0000 to U+FFFF
  and assigned characters to around half of them.
  Many software implementations chose the obvious memory reprentation
  for Unicode text of 16 bits per <a>code point</a> / character.

  As subsequent versions of Unicode assigned more characters,
  it became apparent that 65536 <a>code points</a> would not be sufficient.
  Unicode was extended to 1114111 <a>code points</a> from U+0000 to U+10FFFF,
  and the <a>UTF-16</a> encoding was introduced.
  This encoding preserves compatibility with existing 16-bit based systems
  and represents new (<a title="supplementary code point">supplementary</a>) code points
  as a <a title="surrogate code unit pair">pair</a> of “surrogates”.

  <a>UTF-16</a> is designed to represent any Unicode text,
  but it can not represent a <a>surrogate code point pair</a>
  since the corresponding <a>surrogate code unit pairs</a>
  would instead represent a <a>supplementary code point</a>.
  Therefore, the concept of <a>Unicode scalar value</a> was introduced
  and <a>Unicode text</a> was restricted to not contain any <a>surrogate code point</a>.
  (This was presumably deemed simpler that only restricting pairs.)

  <a>UTF-16</a> was redefined to be <a>ill-formed</a>
  if it contains <a>unpaired surrogate code units</a>.
  <a>UTF-8</a> was similarly redefined to be <a>ill-formed</a>
  if it contains <a>surrogate byte sequences</a>.

  Meanwhile, 16-bit based systems had little to no incentive
  to do anything about surrogates:
  For several years,
  Unicode did not assign any character to <a>supplementary code points</a>,
  and then (until emoji) only comparatively rare characters.
  Additionally, the Unicode Standard does not require conforming implementations
  to maintain <a>well-formedness</a> of <a>UTF-16</a> strings.

  As a result, surrogates do occur in practice and need to be preserved.
  For example:

  <ul>
    <li>
      In ECMAScript (a.k.a. JavaScript),
      <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-4.3.16">
      a <code>String</code> value</a>
      is defined as a sequence of 16-bit integers
      that <em>usually</em> represents <a>UTF-16</a> text
      but may or may not be <a>well-formed</a>.
    <li>
      <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd374069%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">
      Windows applications normally use UTF-16</a>, but
      <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365247%28v=vs.85%29.aspx#maxpath">
      the file system treats path and file names as an opaque sequence of <code>WCHAR</code>s</a>
      (<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa383751%28v=vs.85%29.aspx#WCHAR">16-bit
      code units</a>).
  </ul>

  This specification calls this practice <a>WTF-16</a>.

  <a>Unpaired surrogate code units</a> are the only case
  where an arbitrary sequence of <a>code units</a> is <a>ill-formed</a> in <a>UTF-16</a>.
  <a>UTF-8</a>, however, is more complex
  and maintaining its <a>well-formedness</a> is arguably more valuable.

  This specification defines <a>WTF-8</a>,
  a superset of <a>UTF-8</a> that can losslessly represent
  arbitrary <a>code unit</a> sequences (even if <a>ill-formed</a> in <a>UTF-16</a>)
  but preserves the other <a>well-formedness</a> constraints of <a>UTF-8</a>.

<h2 id=terminology>
Terminology</h2>

  These definitions correspond to those of the
  <a href="http://www.unicode.org/glossary/">Glossary of Unicode Terms</a> [[!UNICODE]],
  except for <a>code unit</a> which is slightly different for the purpose of this specification.

  A Unicode <dfn>code point</dfn> is any value in the Unicode codespace;
  that is, the range of integers from 0 to 1114111.
  It is noted with a “U+” prefix and four to six hexadecimal digits:
  the first and last code points are U+0000 and U+10FFFF.

  The <dfn>Basic Multilingual Plane</dfn> is
  the range of <a>code points</a> from U+0000 to U+FFFF.

  A <dfn>BMP code point</dfn> is a <a>code point</a> in the <a>Basic Multilingual Plane</a>.

  A <dfn>supplementary code point</dfn>
  is a <a>code point</a> not in the Basic Multilingual Plane.
  That is, a <a>code point</a> in the range from U+10000 to U+10FFFF.

  A <dfn>Unicode scalar value</dfn>
  is a <a>code point</a> that is not a <a>surrogate code point</a>.
  That is, a <a>code point</a> in the range from U+0000 to U+D7FF,
  or in the range U+E000 to U+10FFFF.

  A <dfn>BMP scalar value</dfn> is a <a>Unicode scalar value</a>
  in the <a>Basic Multilingual Plane</a>.
  That is, a <a>code point</a> in the range from U+0000 to U+D7FF,
  or in the range U+E000 to U+FFFF.

  <dfn>Unicode text</dfn> is a sequence of <a>Unicode scalar values</a>.

  <dfn>UTF-8</dfn> is an encoding of <a>Unicode text</a> using 8-bit bytes.
  Each <a>Unicode scalar value</a> is represented as a sequence of one to four bytes.

  <dfn>UTF-16</dfn> is an encoding of <a>Unicode text</a> using 16-bit <a>code units</a>.
  <a>BMP scalar values</a> are represented as a single <a>code unit</a> with the same value.
  <a>Supplementary code points</a> are represented as a <a>surrogate code unit pair</a>.

  Note: this specification is only concerned with the UTF-16
  <a href="http://www.unicode.org/glossary/#character_encoding_form">encoding form</a>
  (based on <a>code units</a>),
  and not with the
  <a href="http://www.unicode.org/glossary/#character_encoding_scheme">encoding scheme</a>
  (based on bytes, with UTF-16BE and UTF-16LE variants).

  A string is <dfn title="well-formed|well-formedness">well-formed</dfn>
  (not <dfn title="ill-formed|ill-formedness">ill-formed</dfn>)
  in a given encoding if it follows the specification of that encoding.
  [[!UNICODE]] defines
  <a href="http://www.unicode.org/glossary/#well_formed_code_unit_sequence">
  Well-Formed Code Unit Sequence</a>
  for <a>UTF-8</a> and <a>UTF-16</a>.

  <div class=note>
    In particular:

    <ul>
      <li><a>Unpaired surrogate code units</a> are <a>ill-formed</a> in <a>UTF-16</a>.
      <li><a>Surrogate byte sequences</a> are <a>ill-formed</a> in <a>UTF-8</a>.
    </ul>
  </div>

  The <dfn>replacement character</dfn> is the <a>code point</a> U+FFFD
  <code>REPLACEMENT CHARACTER</code> (&#xFFFD;).
  It is used as a substitute to replace <a>ill-formed</a> sub-sequences
  during a conversion.

  A <dfn>code unit</dfn>, for the purpose of this specification,
  is a 16-bit integer used in <a>UTF-16</a>.
  It is noted with a “0x” prefix and four hexadecimal digits:
  the first and last code units are 0x0000 and 0xFFFF.

  Note: The byte serialization or memory representation of a <a>code unit</a>
  (little-endian or big-endian)
  is out of scope for this specification.

  Note: Unicode also uses this term for 8-bit and 32-bit code units
  in the UTF-8 and UTF-32 encodings.

<h2 id=wtf-16-encoding>
The WTF-16 encoding</h2>

  <dfn>WTF-16</dfn> (Wobbly Transformation Format − 16-bit)
  is an encoding of sequences of <a>code points</a>
  that do not contain a <a>surrogate code point pair</a>
  using 16-bit <a>code units</a>.

  Note: Like <a>UTF-16</a>,
  <a>WTF-16</a> can not represent a <a>surrogate code point pair</a>
  since the corresponding <a>surrogate code unit pair</a> would instead
  represent a <a>supplementary code point</a>.

  It is identical to <a>UTF-16</a>,
  with the <a>well-formedness</a> constraint removed
  and the added semantics that an <a>unpaired surrogate code unit</a>
  represents the corresponding <a>surrogate code point</a>.
  It is a strict superset of <a>UTF-16</a>.

  <a>WTF-16</a> has no <a>well-formedness</a> constraint.
  Any sequence of <a>code units</a> is <a>well-formed</a> in <a>WTF-16</a>.

  To <dfn>encode
  a sequence of <a>code points</a> that does not contain a <a>surrogate code point pair</a>
  to <a>WTF-16</a></dfn>,
  run these steps:

  <ol>
    <li>Let <var>result</var> be a sequence of <a>code units</a>, initially empty.
    <li>For every <a>code point</a> <var>P</var> of the input, run these substeps:
      <ol>
        <li>If <var>P</var> is a <a>supplementary code point</a>, run these substeps:
          <ol>
            <li>
              Append to <var>result</var> a <a>code unit</a> of value
              <code>((<var>P</var> - 0x10000) >> 10) + 0xD800</code>
            <li>
              Append to <var>result</var> a <a>code unit</a> of value
              <code>((<var>P</var> - 0x10000) & 0x3FF) + 0xDC00</code>
          </ol>
        <li>Otherwise (<var>P</var> is a <a>BMP code point</a>),
          append to <var>result</var> a <a>code unit</a> of value <var>P</var>.
      </ol>
    <li>Return <var>result</var>.
  </ol>

  Note: If the input is restricted to <a>Unicode text</a>,
  this is identical to encoding <a>UTF-16</a>
  and the resulting sequence is <a>well-formed</a> in <a>UTF-16</a>.

  <div class=note>

    If, on the other hand, the input <em>does</em> contain a <a>surrogate code point pair</a>,
    the conversion will be incorrect and
    the resulting <a>WTF-16</a> string will not represent the original code points.

    This situation should be considered an error,
    but this specification does not define how to handle it.
    Possibilities include aborting the conversion,
    or replacing one of the <a>surrogate code points</a> of the pair
    with a <a>replacement character</a>.
  </div>

  To <dfn>decode <a>WTF-16</a> to
  a sequence of <a>code points</a> that does not contain a <a>surrogate code point pair</a></dfn>,
  run these steps:

  <ol>
    <li>Let <var>result</var> be a sequence of <a>code points</a>, initially empty.
    <li>For every <a>code unit</a> <var>U</var> of the input, run these substeps:
      <ol>
        <li>
          If <var>U</var> is a <a>lead surrogate code unit</a>
          run these substeps:
          <ol>
            <li>
              Consume the next <a>code unit</a> of the input
              (so that it is skipped by the “for every <var>U</var>” loop)
              and let <var>next</var> be it.
            <li>
              If <var>next</var> is a <a>trail surrogate code unit</a>,
              append to <var>result</var> a <a>code point</a> of value
              <code>
                0x10000 +
                (<var>lead surrogate</var> - 0xD800) × 0x400 +
                (<var>U</var> - 0xDC00)</code>.
            <li>
              Otherwise,
              append to <var>result</var> a <a>code point</a> of value <var>U</var>,
              then a <a>code point</a> of value <var>next</var>.
          </ol>
        <li>
          Otherwise,
          append to <var>result</var> a <a>code point</a> of value <var>U</var>.
      </ol>
    <li>Return <var>result</var>.
  </ol>

  Note: If the input is <a>well-formed</a> in <a>UTF-16</a>,
  this is identical to decoding <a>UTF-16</a>
  and the resulting sequence is <a>Unicode text</a>.
